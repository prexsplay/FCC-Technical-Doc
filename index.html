                <p>Audio recording is often an afterthought for
                    videographers, but it's just as important to your
                    finished product as the recorded video. Good audio
                    recording takes some effort, but it's well worth it.
                    Keep these tips in mind for audio recording that is easy
                    to hear and a pleasure to listen to.

                The microphones that are built into camcorders are usually low quality. They don't always pick up sound
                well,
                and sometimes you end up hearing
                the sound of the camcorder operating. If possible, use an external microphone whenever you shoot
                videos. A
                lavalier, or lapel mic, like the type
                newscasters use, is unobtrusive and
                especially helpful when you want to hear someone's voice clearly.

                If you can plug headphones into your camera, do it. They'll allow you to hear exactly what the camera
                hears, so
                you'll know if your subject is speaking loudly enough or if the background noises are too distracting.
                Use the
                best-quality headphones you have for the truest results.
            </p>
            <p>Background noises are distracting in a video and can complicate the editing process. Turn off fans and
                refrigerators, so you don't hear them humming. If there's a window open, close it to shut out the
                traffic
                noises or the bird tweets.</p>

            <p>Recording outdoors on a windy day is difficult because the impact of the wind on the microphone can
                create loud
                slapping or popping sounds. You can buy a wind protector for your microphone to cut down on this effect
                or—in a
                pinch—slip a fuzzy sock over the mic.</p>

            <p>Think about sounds that are specific to the event you're recording and capture those on tape. If you're
                at a
                carnival, the music of the merry-go-round and the sound of the popcorn popper adds to the mood of your
                video
                and help viewers feel as if they are there with you.

                Record these sounds clearly without worrying about the video footage. While editing, you can move the
                audio
                clips around and have them play underneath different parts of your video.</p>
